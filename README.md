Transformer ChatBot with Google Translate API and Tensorflow Keras

Highly recommend to run in colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1d67mptZFw7RLKsEsY-HfYsznZ5IIzBpq?usp=sharing

Before run, you need to upload the dataset which is called 'reddit_data.txt' to main directory.

As Colab does not support GUI's like Tkinter, Tkinter functions is deactivated with comment symbols.
